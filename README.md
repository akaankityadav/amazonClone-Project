# Amazon.com Clone

This project is a clone of the Amazon.com website built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. It replicates the design and layout of Amazon's homepage and various sections, including the header, product listings, and footer. No JavaScript or back-end functionality is implemented, making this a static site focused solely on front-end development.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The design is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Header Section**: Includes the Amazon logo, search bar, and navigation links.
- **Product Listings**: Replicates product displays with images, titles, prices, and rating stars.
- **Footer Section**: Contains useful links and information, including terms and conditions, privacy policies, and help links.
- **Pure HTML & CSS**: No JavaScript or backend technologies were used. This project focuses solely on using HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## Future Improvements

- Add JavaScript functionality for interactivity, such as dropdown menus and sliders.
- Implement backend features like user authentication and product search.
- Expand the design to include additional Amazon pages (product details, cart, etc.).
